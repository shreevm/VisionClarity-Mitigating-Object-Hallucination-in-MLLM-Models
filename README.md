# VisionClarity-Mitigating-Object-Hallucination-in-MLLM-Models

# Objective
The VisionClarity project aims to create a robust system that detects and mitigates object hallucinations within multimodal LLM models, with a particular emphasis on generating accurate image-to-text descriptions. Object hallucination occurs when the model mistakenly describes objects that are either irrelevant or entirely absent from the image. The goal is to build a more reliable system that delivers precise, grounded image descriptions, thereby minimizing the risk of misinformation.
Designed to be versatile, VisionClarity will cater to a wide range of applications, from educational tools that enhance learning experiences to creative content generation that demands accuracy. By ensuring that the descriptions are not only accurate but also relevant, aim to improve the usability of AI in everyday tasks, making it a valuable resource for users across various domains.
